# Store Simulator

## Overview

**Store Simulator** is a simple console application designed as a learning project. It simulates the basic operations of a store, including managing products, customers, and orders. The main goal is to practice object-oriented programming concepts and essential C# features such as inheritance, interfaces, and file serialization.

## Features

1. **Product Management**  
   Add, update, and remove products with validation on names, prices, and quantities.

2. **Customer Management**  
   Store and manage customer information.

3. **Order Processing**  
   Create and track orders, calculate totals, and manage order statuses.

4. **Data Persistence**  
   Save and load data using JSON serialization to maintain state between program runs.

5. **Object-Oriented Design**  
   Utilizes classes, interfaces, inheritance, and encapsulation for clean and maintainable code.

## Technologies Used

- **C# 10 / .NET 8**  
- Console Application  
- JSON Serialization (System.Text.Json)  
- Collections: List, Dictionary  
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes  
- Exception Handling and Input Validation

## How to Run

1. Open the solution in **Visual Studio 2022** or later.  
2. Build the project to restore dependencies.  
3. Run the program in **Debug** or **Release** mode.  
4. Follow the console prompts to interact with the store simulation.

## Notes

- This project is an **MVP for learning purposes** and is not intended for production use.  
- Future improvements may include a GUI, database integration, and more advanced features.
